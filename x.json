She has worked on the staffs of several Nickelodeon shows, including the Emmy-nominated hit Clarissa Explains it All and The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo. For preschool viewers, she penned multiple stories for the Emmy-nominated Little Bear and Oswald. She also co-wrote the critically acclaimed Rankin/Bass Christmas special, Santa, Baby! Most recently she was the Head Writer for Scholastic Entertainment\u2019s Clifford\u2019s Puppy Days.<br /><br />While working on a Kids WB show called Generation O! she met children\u2019s author James Proimos, who talked her into giving children\u2019s books a try.<br /><br />Thinking one day about Alice in Wonderland, she was struck by how pastoral the setting must seem to kids who, like her own, lived in urban surroundings. In New York City, you\u2019re much more likely to fall down a manhole than a rabbit hole and, if you do, you\u2019re not going to find a tea party. What you might find...? Well, that\u2019s the story of Gregor the Overlander, the first book in her five-part series, The Underland Chronicles. Suzanne also has a rhyming picture book illustrated by Mike Lester entitled When Charlie McButton Lost Power.<br /><br />She currently lives in Connecticut with her family and a pair of feral kittens they adopted from their backyard.<br /><br />The books she is most successful for in teenage eyes are The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mockingjay. These books have won several awards, including the GA Peach Award. ",

					"text": "Suzanne Collins has <s>balls</s> <b>ovaries of steel</b> to make us willingly cheer for a teenage girl to kill other children. In a YA book. <br>Two reasons why this book rocks: <b>(a)</b> It is not <i>Twilight</i>, and <b>(b)</b> I really hate reality shows. <br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1682395988i/34178549.jpg\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"> <br><b>\n  <i>Seriously, how long would it take for reality shows to evolve from \"Survivor\" to \"Hunger Games\"? </i>\n</b><br><br>Yes, this book is full of imperfections. It often requires a strenuous suspension of disbelief. It can cause a painful amount of eye-rolling and shaking fist at the book pages. Its style is choppy and the first-person present tense gets annoying. The story is simple, and the message is heavy-handed. <b>But is does set a better example for young impressionable pre-teens than gushing stories about sparkly co-dependency.</b> And here is an obligatory taken out of contest Twilight-bashing quote: <blockquote>\n  <i>\u201cBut just the fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that happened.\u201d </i>\n</blockquote> <b>So why did I add it to my to-read list for my future (hypothetical) daughter?</b> Because Katniss is cool and a badass. She is fierce, independent, resourceful, intelligent, and skilled. She is loyal to her friends and family. She is a survivor. <b>She will never allow a guy to carry her around as though she is a delicate flower.</b> She skewers that apple in the pig's mouth with an arrow in front of the Gamemakers in the most awesome way imaginable. For all that, I <b>love</b> this imperfect, surly, prickly, sullen and perpetually pissed-off, quick to jump to judgment, and sometimes clueless girl. <br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1682395988i/34178550.jpg\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"> <br><br>And I love this book because - despite <i>The Hunger Games</i> being YA literature that seems to hinge on the romantic puppy love - the happiness of Katniss does not revolve solely around a cute male lead. Yes, there is a (hated) love triangle here *eyeroll* <b>but there are other issues that occupy Katniss' mind - such as the survival of her friends, family, and herself rather than just pining over a cute boy. </b>(*)<blockquote>\n  <i> * Unlike other so-called \"books\", where a boyfriend of a few months dumping you is a valid reason for catatonia and almost-suicide.(**)<br><br>** And yet we still get readers who divide themselves into the incredibly annoying \"Team Peeta\" and \"Team Gale\". (***)<br><br>*** Because <b>clearly</b> nothing else ever matters besides sappy love - in a book about children murdering each other. <b>*eyeroll*</b> </i>\n  <br>\n</blockquote> <img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1682395988i/34178551.jpg\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>Now, here is what bugged me about the romance that DID make it into the book. <b>There is actually a LOST OPPORTUNITY here to have a YA book where people CAN be just friends, where devotion and loyalty stem from friendship and respect and not from attraction. </b> <br><br>Katniss and Peeta could have had plenty of other reasons to care for each other that don't include puppy love - they are from the same district, same school, he gave her that bread, she trades with his dad, etc. But alas, that did not happen. I understand that Collins had to cater to the way that YA publishers and Hollywood tend to view us, the female audience. <b>At least Katniss escapes the perils of insta-love.</b> But poor Peeta - all of his actions are colored by him being \"Lover Boy\", and I think it detracts from his personality and reduces him from a kind compassionate person to a fool in love who'd do anything for Katniss only because of his physical attraction to her. Yeah...<br><br>...Rue...Oh, Rue...<img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1682395988i/34178552.jpg\" width=\"320\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"> <br><br>Now, back to the GOOD. Rue, my favorite character. Little, fragile, almost-too-perfect Rue who was clearly doomed from the start.<b> Who despite her appearance was neither weak nor helpless.</b> Whose <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"c7a03250-7856-4d81-9ba7-1240acadb7f3\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"c7a03250-7856-4d81-9ba7-1240acadb7f3\">death scene</label> brought the human side to Katniss (who, until that point, was almost bordering on robotic). There was real grief and anger and sadness in that scene, and from that point on I began to care. <br><br>Suzanne Collins strictly follows the <b>\"show, don't tell\" </b>rule. (Actually, she does it to such an extent that the book reads almost like a screenplay.) The plot moves along at a fast pace, only slowing down a bit in the drawn out Capitol makeover and cave makeout sessions. Collins does not shy away from gruesome scenes, making many parts of the book hit home.<br>----------<br>I enjoyed it despite the imperfections. Katniss easily beats the majority of the popular YA heroines. And because of all her coolness, this gets <b>3.75 stars</b>. <blockquote>\n  <i>\"Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow it just won't seem sincere if I'm trying to slit his throat.\" </i>\n</blockquote>-----------------------------------------<br><b>\n  <u>EDITED TO ADD:</u>\n</b> <br>So I saw the movie today. All I have to say - Suzanne Collins may have given life to Katniss, but Jennifer Lawrence definitely gave her heart. Lawrence's Katniss has such emotional depth, and she brings such truthfulness to her character. Excellent adaptation with a great balance of tugging on the heartstrings and darkness.<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1682395988i/34178553.jpg\" width=\"400\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"> <p><b><i>I CRIED TWICE </i></b>(yes, apparently I am less of a cynic than I thought). <br>First time - when Katniss volunteers for Prim and people salute her. I JUST CHOKED UP. It felt so real. I have a brother who is much younger than me, and all I could think at that moment was how I would do the exact same thing for him <b>WITHOUT ANY HESITATION</b>. It wouldn't even be a choice. Just like it wasn't for Katniss. *Sob* <br>The second time I teared up - <b>Rue. Oh Rue...</b> And the salute from District 11 - so powerful and so touching. I...I...I just can't... <br><br><b><i>PLEASE EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO AND GRAB A BOX OF TISSUES. OR TWO. OR TEN.</i></b> *SOB*</p></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]></[\"br\"]>",

					"text": "I was forced into watching Mockingjay: Part II this weekend. To clarify, I watched the second part of the last <i>Hunger Games</i> movie <b>without having read any of the books, without having watched any of the movies.</b><br /><br />Needless to say, I was <i>confused as fuck</i>.<br /><br />So many questions and thoughts ran through my mind as I watched the movie. Why is Peeta so thin? Did that huge-ass bruise really disappear from her neck the next day? Is Katniss <i>supposed</i> to look like she's about to burst into tears at any given moment, or is that just Jennifer Lawrence? Woody Harrelson is in this movie? Hey, it's Margaery from Game of Thrones! Who's President Snow? What's a Mockingjay? Lesser Hemsworth is pretty hot.<br /><br />Well, you get the point. I know how the book ended and I still have no idea who anyone is, and neither do I know their names, with the exception of Peeta, Gale, President Snow, that Coin woman, and Katniss. Of course, knowing how the book ended means I probably should read the first book, so <b>here I am, the last person on earth to read The Hunger Games.</b><br /><br />And it was good. It was really good. My sister was right (she usually is).<br /><br />What else can I say that hasn't already been said? I loved it. The world building was interesting (although it helps that I've seen what it looks like on the big screen), and Katniss is <i>awesome</i>. One of the things my sister didn't like about the first movie is that the on-screen Katniss was different from her portrayal in the first book. I haven't watched that movie, but I kind of see how the screen portrayal of Katniss might have bothered her. Book-Katniss is strong, kick-ass without being a Mary Sue. She has a fierce love for her sister, and she is manipulative and cunning. She uses the prospect of romance to protect herself, she has no qualms about using people, and I love that about her.<br /><br />Time to watch Movie #1!",

But basically the TL;DR of this review is that <i>The Hunger Games</i> truly holds up so well in 2020, and this reread was such a treat. I felt such nostalgia, happiness, and hope between these pages, and I already can\u2019t wait to revisit this story again. Also, again, this review will have <b>spoilers</b>, so use caution if you don\u2019t want me to tell you what happens in each chapter of this book!<br><br><i>\n  <b>\u201cHow could I leave Prim, who is the only person in the world I'm certain I love?\u201d</b>\n</i><br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter One: </b><br>This first chapter really starts off with a heartbreaking bang. We quickly learn so many characters, but we even more quickly learn what type of character Katniss Everdeen is. The basic premise of this tale is that there are twelve districts and once a year each district will select two young candidates to fight to the death in a game, which will also be broadcasted for the world to see. Every year, a teenagers name gets added once to this random selection pool, but each year they get older another time their name gets added. Also, you can add your name more times to get food and supplies for your family, and this is very much the norm for most children. Katniss\u2019s sister, Prim, only has her name in the drawing once because it is her first time, where Katniss has her name added over twenty times. Yet, you see where this is going\u2026<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Two: </b><br>Once Prim\u2019s name is pulled, Katniss immediately volunteers to take her place in the games. Meanwhile, the boy contestant is Peeta Mellark, who Katniss remembers giving her bread when her family was starving after the death of their father. Together, they are thrown into a competition that no one believes they will be able to come back alive. Especially since only one victor is allowed, therefore one of them will most certainly have to die.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Three: </b><br>Katniss is given her iconic mockingjay pin that will literally change the world as she knows it.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Four: </b><br>Haymitch punches Peeta to make him look rougher, lol. The journey Haymitch is about to take alongside these two kids as their mentor, whew.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Five: </b><br>Cinna (my favorite character), makes Katniss a fire dress in which the world has never seen, and will be the first time the world finds it extremely hard to forget her or her name. Also, unknown to Katniss, a start of a public romance is brewing with Peeta to help their image. We also get to meet President Snow and start to get a vibe of all the evil things he has been stirring up for some time now.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Six: </b><br>Katniss and Peeta make it to the training center and they start to learn about the other candidates from the other districts. We also get to learn about the different privileges of the other districts, and how some of these candidates view this as an honor to volunteer their life for (without needing to save a little sister). We also get to see Rue, and it\u2019s really hard to not feel like you want to reach into the pages and protect her yourself.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Seven: </b><br>Katniss makes quite the impression with an arrow and an apple, that many important people of the Capitol find very hard to ignore.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Eight: </b><br>This is the start of the Peeta versus Gale debate, and the brewing of a very opinionated love-triangle. For me, personally, I always think it\u2019s obvious in Katniss\u2019s inner monologue that she only likes Peeta, but I digress.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Nine: </b><br>We get to meet Caesar Flickerman and see Katniss and Peeta\u2019s vastly different interviews with him. Peeta is coached to very much play the star-crossed lovers card, and he even tells Caesar that he loves Katniss more than anything.<br><br><b> \u27bd Chapter Ten: </b><br>This is the start of Part 2, where they games are finally going to begin. And Cinna says my favorite line in the entire series to Katniss.

					"text": "A lot of things are troubling me about The Hunger Games. A lot of things which I more and more perceive and which are not solely connected with this book but with the metaphor behind the words. People attach themselves to fictional freedom without seeing what really something is and which unfortunately is here to stay because you can't wake a person who is pretending to be asleep. You can\u2019t make a shift on a deeper level, if the only thing that attracts you to this book is \u2013 a vision of fight, retaliation and the outcome of freedom. Freedom of flesh. <br /><br />In comparison to the freedom of and from your mind which is nowhere to be found. <br /><br />And this is why I detest this book, although detest is such a strong from the ego word. Because the whole purpose of this story is to show how people shouldn\u2019t sacrifice their children for the better of their communities and with the positive outcomes realise that we are so much stronger and yada yada. <br /><br />THE WHOLE PURPOSE of this book should be that there shouldn\u2019t even be in the first place a need to sacrifice members of our society for some other people to be amused. And where after the battle of ''united'' people we heal and repair the damages for the better tomorrow. The society cancer of western civilisation thinking. <br /><br />Heal the damage, never heal the cause of it. <br /><br />But then we wouldn\u2019t be talking here about the same book. We would be discussing how humanity can help each other with being better, with taking responsibility and with being open to each other. <br /><br />And yet imagine this paradox we live in: better, as if the majority of population can even understand that we are in constant blood thirst to achieve peace. With war comes peace. While along the way we are trying to be better and safer. Yet most people deliberately choose to live on the utmost lowest level of their existence. In fear, frightened of itself.<br /><br />And people read books which are so extreme in their bullshit. And people connect with Katniss because she is the heroine. She has managed to outsmart the system. Instead of thinking that she was not even supposed be there in the first place. Because we live in society that does this to their children. <br /><br />''No, we don\u2019t!''<br /><br />''We do...''<br /><br />''But children can learn how to fight.''<br /><br />''You teach them to fight for individual puppeteers. And instead of working on yourself, how to achieve your inner peace, you associate yourself again with the group because it feels better to be in the tortured crowd, instead of being alone and awakened.''<br /><br />''What are you talking about? It is just emo gibberish. Leave Katniss alone. And in the end, it is just a book. Why don\u2019t you want people to read and educate themselves, does everything have to be deep and meaningful, can\u2019t you just relax?''<br /><br />Yes, everything has to be deep and meaningful since we are drowning in shit of meaningless and shallow. The system as it is, the plot of this book is just another evidence to show us how we are controlled. That we are left barren from our true selves which we only find in empathy, love towards each other and genuinely understanding that we are one and everything is one. But on this provincial&amp;marginal&amp;primitive&amp;emotional level, so many took this book for granted. <br /><br />And the only reason I am writing this review here, the only reason I am giving it so much attention is to tell what is on my mind since it is so widely popular and since I have read it. And one of the main reasons why I can\u2019t really keep things light and popsy is because so many things are already deep down in gutter light and popsy and mainstream. As if having money is any critieria for life, as if not having your own free will and education and information means nothing. And the other side of the rich coin is poverty with people who believe in symbols, who are sidetracked with religions, censured TV, economy and utter lack of information circulation. <br /><br />And a lot of people here are trying to disregard this review and want to reassure me that I am so terribly wrong. BUT, you have yet not seen what I am talking about and it is perfectly OK. <br /><br />So I followed as well screaming Goodreads recommendations and I bought a book that is stupid, violent and written so plainly but of course written for vast masses so they can be touched by fake social awareness. Because it is fake, but most of all it\u2019s tragic. <br /><br />And this is not a critique toward Collins, in my nature of a thinker and seeing her a person who shared her thoughts and which millions of people loved and connected with, I am still a firm believer that the general public just didn\u2019t understand what she was talking about. And this is my silver lining. Because it has been like this throughout centuries and with the biggest thinkers of our civilisation. What they meant and wanted to show, is definitely not what most of the public projected. <br /><br />Because the mainstream public is a group of sheep, not seeing anything properly, but following and like a Tarzan, screaming, don\u2019t you dare stealing my Jane from me. As a metaphor, don\u2019t you dare telling me these uplifting emotions are not true, when all in me about this book tells me that is correct and how people should live their lives. <br /><br />And if the mainstream likes it, uh, then definitely that is not what it\u2019s true. <br /><br />It is just a constant reminder how so many things are left unrecognised while these superficial stories which evoke cheap emotions are always so hugely praised. It could have been just a little story but never underestimate the obese octopus that is called In God And Country We Trust - code red mentality. Mentality of humans which are too ignorant, beautifully naive and untouched basically with what is means to be socially aware. <br /><br />And although this is a teen book, it is more deeply hurting and sickening because if you want to influence somebody, of course you will influence the children \u2013 and yet there is nothing that children can learn from it. They can learn some things, we all need little courageous Katniss, but on a deeper subtler level is it just an intravenous injection of more Nothing and more Numbing and more Disconnected. <br /><br />At least they read is one of the arguments. And argument as fruitfull as at least they eat GMO food. One food for the blind intellect, other for the digestion which both results in basic survival without any interference of you in all of it. Because it takes courage and guts and a pinch of anarchy to stop, turn around and start questioning what is handed. <br /><br />For me, the thought about giving this to a child is sickening especially because we live in this world where all the life criterias are upside down. Because a child will not learn how things are vile and disturbing because Katniss told them through her delusional and hyperventilating focus, but a child will learn about life\u2019s cruelty, and it will be touched by it sooner or later, by questioning everything that is served in front of it. <br /><br />Because if it is served somebody is earning money and you are just getting fatter and sicker. <br /><br />And the children will learn how to question if you teach them how to find not if you broadcast them the answers. Not if you teach them through aggressive examples and if you keep the nation in cold sweat especially if you are lucky enough to live in the countries where oppression is not the issue but consumerism, body image and mediocrity have you on the leash. <br /><br />I am astonished with a fact that around 75.000 Goodreads members read this book and that around 50.000 of them rated it 5 stars. What is it that fascinates them so much. <br /><br />It\u2019s disturbing because people obviously associate and find themselves in this book. And it's about a girl Katniss Everdeen, living in the far away future, who was chosen to participate in a cruel Big Brother game, in which 24 contestants (children age 12-18) kill each other, because live TV has become demanding, and the public loves reality blood and violence. That's it. A little bit of undeveloped and unbelievable romance between her and two boys, a little bit of her abandoned family problems, a little bit of The 5th element movie political structure, mutants and pop stylists. It\u2019s so screwed up. <br /><br />In the beginning, first 50 pages were well written. There was suspense, Katniss was sweet and witty, but overall this book is a shitty meltdown. Adding the ridiculous cliffhanger ending. Some people here are using words like dystopian literature, and then write essays about how this book is the core of it. <br /><br />The core is pointlessly graphic and sadistic, without any concrete message except of the negative: this book is just proving that the world today is fucked up if this book is so successful. I don\u2019t see the point of reading about the fictional kids who are doing this to each other. <br /><br />In a metaphorical way it is promoting political establishments of certain countries and that is getting tiring. Not all people are eager to swallow the shit of general brainwashing. Katniss being the heroine (ironical quote marks). Being loyal and darling and a role model. Just wake up. Life is happening and some pretty dark things are happening while you are thinking that Katniss is the representative of the club called liberation. <br /><br />For me, in a bookish way it stands for one bad one night stand, kiss and forget. But as always, readers tend to bring fiction to their real life and just as many think that kittens and superheroes are comfort zones, a lot of readers perceive this plot as their own little shrine. <br /><br />But that is me not being in tune with the mainstream population which is too distracted with billboards. <br /><br />Because it is easier, because why protest, why not simply take what you are given - eat your GMO Monsanto's company hamburgers, eat your cancer giving Nestle products and think that The Hunger Games are the best franchise ever, like ever. If you don't have any arguments about real life activism and if you think that there is deepness in this plot which I have yet not seen so you need to enlightened me, just include North Korea or Hitler or ISIS(L) or those poor people who are closed in Zara hangers who work nonstop ''somewhere'' in the world because obviously you are aware of the crisis although you don\u2019t think you could show on the map but you have heard somewhere on Murdoch media. <br /><br />This shit sells. It's genuinely bad but excellently targeted. You know, it evokes pride and loyalty and massacring children, freedom and scandal and Hollywood. It goes very well with all the Kardashian filth. As long as it sells, sells, sells. And marketing agencies know that people are united when they are jealous, when they want and they with those hamburgers want freedom. Nobody is going to kill their Katniss in a goddam book! Really? Take a look around you. <br /><br />And then the punch line for this book comes from the so called activism from the shopping mall. People who devour literature of this kind and think that everything is all right while in the same time, fuck, you are getting oozingly fat. <br /><br />Bottom line.<br /><br />This book is very shallow and MTV culture oriented, like a classical example of easy consummated pop-literature; I'm very surprised that it didn't come with some trash magazine subscription. If it doesn't have savage brutality, prize money and prefix ''media coverage'' then it won't be appealing and educational because surely this is how children of 21st century survive this techno media world; through examples of true moral issues and realistic outcomes. Have another gulp of Coca-Cola along the way while you listen to dubstep shit. <br /><br />It saddens me when a violent hillbillish book is so popular. What is there to truly identify yourself with. Except if your chicken soup for soul are basic emotions which come with buy 1 get 1 free.<br />",

					"text": "I read this when it was first published, ordering it before I knew it was YA, and years before any films (which I've not seen). If I were a teenager or recommending this to a teen, I might give it 3*; as an adult, I give it 2*.<br /><br />PLOT<br /><br />It's a potentially exciting but gruesome story, but most of the characters were rather flat, and much of the plot was predictable, partly because it's not hugely original. See Shirley Jackson's <b>The Lottery</b>, which I reviewed <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2084179141\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">HERE</a>, and the Japanese <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/57891.Battle_Royale\" title=\"Battle Royale by Koushun Takami\" rel=\"noopener\">Battle Royale</a>. Furthermore, there were too many flaws in the plot. I fail to understand its very high ratings.<br /><br />Post-apocalyptic America (Panem) is divided into a wealthy and technologically advanced Capitol and twelve subsidiary districts of oppressed people who exist in dire poverty, with inadequate food, housing, and health care and hardly any technology. To reinforce the power of the Capitol by instilling fear in the population, once a year, two children from each region are selected by lots to fight to the death in a reality show. If that were not bad enough, the whole thing is utterly corrupt in multiple ways, plus the public bet on the outcome, and sponsors can sway the results. Did I mention these are <b>children</b>? (Some are as young as 12, though the narrator is 16.) A compulsory full-body wax on a teen seems rather pervy and who would want to bet on, let alone sponsor a child-killing tournament, even if it's by helping one of the contestants? As the book keeps reminding readers, one person's survival is only possible by the death of <b>all</b> the others.<br /><br />CRUELTY TO CHILDREN<br /><br />I realise that horrendous things are done to children around the world every day (extreme poverty, child soldiers, sexual assault, genital mutilation etc), but in none of those cases is the <b>sole intention</b> that <b>all</b> but one child dies, and nor is it organised by the <b>government</b> for a sick combination of sport, entertainment, punishment and profit. <br /><br />Humans often lack compassion, but I was never convinced by Collins' world - especially the fact this outrage has continued for <b>three generations</b> (it's the 74th games), apparently without the Capitol even needing to invoke gods or supernatural powers to justify their cruelty! Could a barbaric annual tournament really be such a powerful incentive not to rise up in all that time? (I don't think so.)<br /><br />BIG ISSUES<br /><br />Nevertheless, it tackles some big themes that are particularly pertinent to teens: the nature of friendship; divided loyalties; the difference between love and friendship; who to trust; whether the ends justify the means; the need to repay favours; the danger of power, wealth and celebrity; the corrupting influence of reality TV; the need for independence, and whether you can trust a parent who abandons you. <br /><br />It all feels rather laboured to me, but it might not if I were a teen, which only reinforces my puzzlement at the number of adults who have enjoyed it. I must be missing something.<br /><br />NARRATIVE STRUCTURE <br /><br />Nearly half the book is backstory and preparation for the games; the remainder is a tale of hunter and hunted. I predicted the main plot twist less than a quarter of the way in (and the fact that Katniss is telling the story limits the possible outcomes), but the suspense was broken when it was made explicit way before the end. There are some other twists between then and the final page, but by then I was rather annoyed with the whole thing.<br /><br />IMPLAUSIBILITY AND INCONSISTENCIES<br /><br /><b>If</b> I'd enjoyed the book more, I would have found it easier to suspend my disbelief, but as it was, I was constantly irked by questions and inconsistencies. <br /><br />* The contestants (and their parents and grandparents) have been forced to watch the games every year of their lives. I suppose they had become inured to it, but on the other hand, that meant they <b>knew</b> the horror of it. I just didn't believe there was as little fear in them as there appeared to be - given that they are children. <br />* Participants don't want other participants to know where they are, yet sponsor gifts occasionally drop out of the sky, via silver parachute; not a risk, apparently. <br />* It's all filmed by numerous invisible floating cameras (I can buy that), but that somehow includes filming inside a cave that is virtually sealed (I can't). <br />* How (and why) would any of these participants be able to measure time to within half hour intervals?<br />* How big is Panem? It can only be a tiny part of the USA because each district specialises in only one thing (coal mining, agriculture etc) and has just one town square that can accommodate everyone (8,000 people in District 12) and yet it's a day's train journey from District 12 to the Capitol. It doesn't seem like a very plausible settlement pattern in a post-disaster world, even given the totalitarian regime (concentrating people in a few centres makes it easier to observe and perhaps control them, but it also creates more opportunities for opposition movements to develop).<br /><br />COMPARED WITH LORD OF THE FLIES<br /><br />There are some similarities with \"Lord of the Flies\" (my review here: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/47291441\">http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...</a>), but although \"The Hunger Games\" is likely to have more appeal to modern teens, I think there are (at least) two crucial differences:<br /><br />* In LotF one person's survival is not necessarily at the cost of everyone else's. (It is even possible that they could all survive.)<br /><br />* LotF has much more depth and symbolism: it tackles original sin; the mystical \"Beast\"; leadership, tribal allegiance and group dynamics (including bullying and attitudes to difference and minor disability) and the importance of ritual and belief.<br /><br />The second point is what makes LotF a better book, in my opinion. <br /><br />Of course, there are other, more obvious, parallels with extreme \"reality\" shows such as \"Survivor\" and \"I'm a Celebrity, get me out of here\", but the fundamental differences are not just that contestants in those shows do not fear for their lives, but that they are adults who have <b>chosen</b> to enter. <br /><br />I TRIED TO ENJOY IT!<br /><br />Any fans who read this will now hate me. I wanted to enjoy this book, and I read it all the way through, making notes as usual, but to no avail. Sorry.",

					"text": "For a long time now, I\u2019ve wanted to rewrite my review of <i>The Hunger Games</i> so that I could tell you why I don\u2019t just love this series, but why I also think it\u2019s important. It is beautiful for the unflinching way it shows you, as a reader, your own willingness to disregard people who are different from you - how you are the Capitol audience. But, it is important as a story about girls. I had not initially thought about articulating that point because it seemed so obvious to me, and I am bad at recognizing my own assumptions. Lately, though, I have seen so many people, both men and women, acting as though this remarkable book is a piece of fluff that I realized maybe what I love most about <i>The Hunger Games</i> is not as obvious as it seems. To me, this series is important because it is a landmark departure from the traditional story about girls.<br /><br />Too often, stories objectify women. But the word \u201cobjectify,\u201d I\u2019ve realized, has almost no meaning for someone who has either not experienced objectification or who hasn\u2019t really recognized it in her own life, so I\u2019m going to be more descriptive here. When I say stories objectify girls, I mean they <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5470.1984\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">talk</a> <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3876.The_Sun_Also_Rises\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">about</a> <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7588.A_Portrait_of_the_Artist_as_a_Young_Man\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">girls</a> <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70401.On_the_Road\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">as</a> <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44796.The_Moon_And_Sixpence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">though</a> <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43641.Water_for_Elephants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">they</a> <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/930.Memoirs_of_a_Geisha\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">are</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9sd05S0hBM&amp;feature=fvst\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">fleshlights</a> that sometimes have handy dandy extra gadgets such as an <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4667024-the-help\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">all-purpose cleaning mechanism</a> and <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41865.Twilight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">food dispensing function</a>. <br /><br />Sidebar: if you are inclined to now google the word \"fleshlight,\" I encourage you to consult the <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fleshlight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">urban dictionary definition here</a> before doing that, as the google results will probably be NSFW and also NSF those of you whose parents might check your browsing history. Do parents know how to do that? Sorry for the sidebar, I am just intending to make an explicit point, and now I am feeling uncomfortable about what that explicit point might mean to the target audience of this book. Girls, you are probably badass like Katniss, and you are definitely <i>not</i> a fleshlight. <br /><br />Back to my rant about typical objectification in storytelling: often the <s>girls</s> fleshlights have <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4671.The_Great_Gatsby\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">fancy outer designs</a> <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8525590-wither\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"> because it makes the fleshlights happy to be fancy</a>. Sometimes they have <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6867.Atonement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">skeeeeeery castration functions</a>, and other times they work as <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/968.The_Da_Vinci_Code\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">helpful databases</a> for <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/285092.High_Fidelity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">music</a> or <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/954674.Little_Brother\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">video games</a> or <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6186357-the-maze-runner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">whatever UR into</a>. A lot of times, I will hear people refer to this type of objectification as treating women like they are just a vagina, or a pair of boobs, but I think there is something to the stories that is less human and more sexbot machine than that complaint covers.<br /><br />So, in all of those links, I have tried to include books written by men and by women because I think that women think of ourselves this way almost as often as men think of us this way. The link from <i>The Ugly Truth</i>, for example, shows both a man and a woman treating women like fleshlights. I have also included both books I love and books I hate because, ultimately, I do think girls adopt this story about themselves, and I also think we can pretty easily identify with a male protagonist and disregard female characters who look nothing like humans. For example, <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> is one of my favorite books in the whole world, even though it does not contain any women who resonate with my experience of humans. And I don't think it's necessarily bad that I can enjoy stories where women are only fleshlights, as long as I can still be whoever I want to be without a positive role model. I think it's good to enjoy stories and take what we can get from them, and so I don't regret that I love <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>.<br /><br />In seeing some male reactions to <i>The Hunger Games</i>, I am reminded that most men do not identify with female protagonists the way women have been trained to identify with male protagonists. This seems like a huge disadvantage for men to be in, to me, and if you are a man reading this review, I would ask you to check out your bookshelves. How many female authors are on your shelves? How many of the books those authors wrote have no central male character? If you have a minute after that, check the shelves of a woman you are friends with and see how many of her books were written by men or have no central female character. Odds are the results will be pretty different.<br /><br /><i>The Hunger Games</i> is such a groundbreaking and deliberate example of a woman\u2019s perspective on war and family and even men that it floors me. I think it partly floors me because, other than <i>Buffy</i>, I can\u2019t think of another example of a female character who really fights for herself in such an obvious and hopeful way. Katniss is strong and broken, and powerful in her brokenness. Collins\u2019s image of a woman\u2019s perspective is not, admittedly, as effortless as Moira Young\u2019s in <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/9917938.Blood_Red_Road__Dust_Lands___1_\" title=\"Blood Red Road (Dust Lands, #1) by Moira Young\" rel=\"noopener\">Blood Red Road</a>, but its deliberateness has its own value. <br /><br />It is not an accident that the story shows Katniss\u2019s emotional growth and that Peeta, as a more emotionally whole person, facilitates her emotional growth. It is not an accident that the story does not discuss the effect Katniss has on the erectness of Peeta\u2019s and Gale\u2019s penises. The first is not an accident because in reality, men do not have to be the emotional cowards that the stories I\u2019ve linked to above make them out to be. Masculinity does not have to mean emotional cowardice. The second is not an accident because the story is not from Peeta and Gale\u2019s perspectives. Despite widespread rumors to the contrary, it is my experience that women pretty seldom think about their effect on men\u2019s penises. Hopefully, we <i>never</i> think of our primary purpose in life, in the way so many stories think of it, as making penises erect. Hopefully, we never think of ourselves as gadgets that are super fun for other people.<br /><br />There are so many reasons I love <i>The Hunger Games</i> series, and all of this is one I wouldn\u2019t have initially even thought to say. I saw this Eleanor Roosevelt quote earlier this month, and it said, \u201cIt is better to light one small candle than to curse the darkness.\u201d I think <i>The Hunger Games</i> is a candle in the overall dark narrative of girls\u2019 perspective on life. Yes, it is also a poignant critique of reality TV and Western callousness about the catastrophes caused by industrialization in the developing world, but that, too, resonates with me in many ways because of its remarkably feminine voice. It absolutely makes sense to me that this book is not for everyone because of its violence, but I still think that it is objectively important because it shows a perspective that seems authentically feminine to me \u2013 that talks like a girl, not like a sexy, fancy gadget. I\u2019m not saying that in my opinion girls don\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t ever think about being sexy or erect penises, I\u2019m just saying that it is my experience that we think and care about many, many more things than penises, clean houses, and food, and very, very few stories are willing to tell you about that. The <i>Hunger Games</i> is one that does, and it does so in way that is beautiful and important. ",

I don't know why I didn't when it was a series that completely took over my life for a short while. But recently I've been thinking about posting something in this review space and after just watching the second film (which I think was amazing and better than the first), now seems like as good a time as any to talk about why I love Katniss and nearly everything about this series.<br><br>I gave this book four stars back in 2011 and I'm going to leave that rating as it is because it's an indicator of my thoughts at the time (though they slightly differ now) - thoughts which were influenced by having just finished the fantastic, horrifying, brutal and unforgettable <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/57891.Battle_Royale\" title=\"Battle Royale by Koushun Takami\" rel=\"noopener\">Battle Royale</a> manga series. I don't think it was the best time for myself and Katniss to find one another when I had so much beautiful insanity to compare the book to, but it still managed to have such an effect on me that I instantly told every friend and family member to read it. Coming back to this now after having spent the last couple of years being bombarded with dystopian YA, I appreciate what Collins has achieved a whole lot more. <br><br>I appreciate the strength of Katniss as a heroine who commands our attention and holds our love whilst still being what some would consider unlikable; I appreciate the balance of beauty and horror that Collins delivers on every page, treating us constantly to both the darkest despair and rays of hope; and I also - amazingly - appreciate the love triangle. Love triangles seem to have chased me and hunted me down with every YA read I picked up over the last two or three years - my dislike for romance instantly becoming doubled by the introduction of yet another boy with beautiful eyes. But Katniss, Peeta and Gale worked for me. They convinced me, held my interest and made me cry. The love triangle worked because it's outcome wasn't obvious, because we all wondered and hoped and worried. <b>Because, either way, I was always going to be half happy and half sad.</b><br><br>Katniss still remains for me everything that a female protagonist should be. Or a female hero, at least. She fights for the ones she loves, she's brave and doesn't need to be saved. But neither is she a one-dimensional smiling poster-version of a heroine. She falls, she fails, people get hurt because of her and she has to live with that. We love her and yet she's antisocial, awkward and moody. She loves other people with all her heart but she's not much of a team player. In short: she's a complex portrait of a young woman that doesn't fall into any neatly defined boxes or categories. Now, perhaps, authors have since tried to recreate her. But she's still one of the first and best.<br><br>I know another review of this book isn't needed. I know you've all probably read it anyway. Or never will. But this isn't really for anyone else; it's a reminder to myself of why this book deserves its hype and why I need to remember to come back to it again and again between the new (and hopefully amazing) YA books I'll be reading in the future.",

This competition is showed to television to be seen by all citizens.<br><br>So, Katniss' little sister, Prim, is selected for the games, but Katniss took her place to save her. <br><blockquote>\n  <b>\n    <i>\"I volunteer! I volunteer as tribute!\"</i>\n  </b>\n</blockquote><br>The boy who was chosen to participate was Peeta Mellark, a boy who Katniss knew because she saved her from starvation and give her some bread as a result his mother beat him!<br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1502449957ra/23563065.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>------------------------------------------------<br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1501927455i/23511022._SY540_.jpg\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br>------------------------------------------------<br><br>1) I loved Peeta! He protected her but I will admit she protected him as well! She risked her life to get the medicine needed to heal his leg. But how can she not see that he is madly in love with her? I loved it when he told her about her singing for the music class, that's when Peeta realized he was in love with her when he saw that the birds were listening like they did for her father.<br><blockquote>\n  <b>\n    <i>\u201cNo, it happened. And right when your song ended, I knew - just like your mother - I was a goner,\" Peeta says.\u201d </i>\n  </b>\n</blockquote><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1460194272ra/18710518.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>2)I think she has feelings for him deep down! Very deep. <br><blockquote>\n  <b>\n    <i>\u201cI don't want to lose the boy with the bread.\u201d </i>\n  </b>\n</blockquote> <br>Sometimes when she kissed Peeta she felt guilty because of Gale! Why????He is her best friend! At the beginning, she said that she never saw him that way and now what? She is confusing me.<br>Please, not love triangle again!!I liked Gale but no! <br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1474463674ra/20603130.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br>3)Curiously, I liked Haymitch! He won the Hunger Games of his time. He is also Katniss' and Peeta's mentor. It seems at first that he doesn't like Katniss very much but at the Hunger Games he helped her more than he helped Peeta. <br><blockquote>\n  <b>\n    <i>\u201cHere's some advice.

She was the 12-year-old female tribute from District 11. I really liked that Katniss allied with Rue. They were amazing together. But Rue died. <br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1502449957ra/23563060.gif\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br>I understand only one can win( our case two) but I felt so sad when she died.

					"text": "<b>Already Want to Read This Again\u2026\u2026</b><br /><br />Wow! That was amazing! <br /><br />Yes, yes. I\u2019ve already seen the movie, but the book is so much better.<br /><br />In The Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen is scraping by, just trying to make her daily living, hunting by her bow in the forest to feed her family. Every year, The Capitol requires every district to offer up one boy and one girl as tributes. The tributes fight each other to the death until only one person survives. This fight is called The Hunger Games.<br /><br />The day of the Reaping finally comes. This is the day where the one boy and one girl are selected. Unfortunately, Prim, Katniss\u2019s younger sister is selected. In an incredible act of bravery, Katniss volunteers to take her sister\u2019s place. Will Katniss make it through The Hunger Games?<br /><br />First of all, the narrator on this was perfect. She even did the accent for the Capitol people, and she sang the song. <br /><br />Second, The Hunger Games is a perfect dystopian novel. It has different dresses and customs, but it isn\u2019t overkill or confusing. <br /><br />There are also many parallels to today\u2019s society. For example, why do the citizens allow The Hunger Games? Because they don\u2019t believe that their children will be selected. How many people believe that they will never be unemployed, never get divorced, never become seriously ill or injured? People like betting on themselves. But we, as a society, aren\u2019t we better off if we made sure that there were strong safety nets in place for those who happen on hard times? <br /><br />In The Hunger Games, all is also not equal. The tributes can have sponsors who rain down much needed supplies on the tributes. We like to think that everyone has an equal opportunity. But is that really the case when the rich can purchase private ACT/SAT tutors for their children? What about those who start their first job and have strong allies and mentors from day one? <br /><br />But I also loved this book, because it had many small acts of kindness.<br /><br /><i>\u201cKind people have a way of working their way inside me and rooting there.\u201d \u2013 The Hunger Games</i><br /><br />With cruelty becoming commonplace, kindness stands out. When District 11 came together, I racked my brain trying to remember the last time that we, as a society, came together for a cause, and I came up short. I think the world is hungry for a rallying cry, a cause that we can all fight together for. What would the world be like if the cruelty was replaced by kindness? Full disclosure: may have cried just a little bit reading this.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next book in the series\u2026.<br /><br />-\tThe Girl On Fire<br /><br /><b>Connect With Me!</b><br /><a href=\"https://lisaoftroy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Blog</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lisa_of_Troy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Twitter</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvmSewQ0IGOzDnuMZNUKTbg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">BookTube</a> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LisaofTroy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Facebook</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lisa_of_troy/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Insta</a>",

					"text": "I LOVE THIS BOOK! I've said to a few people that if I wasn't married, I'd have to marry this book. :) I read the 400 page ARC in a less-than-24-hour time period (so quickly that it was never even on my \"currently reading\" shelf), which I've only done before with HP books, and I've just officially put the first book on my 2008 favorites shelf. I feel pretty safe in saying that if this isn't still my favorite book of the year when next January rolls around, that I'll eat a hat. As soon as I finished reading it, I turned around and read it a 2nd time, which I've never done before in my life. I loved all of Collins' GREGOR books, and think she's a wonderful writer, but she's ratcheted it up to another level with this one. Even though it's the first in a trilogy, this one definitely stands alone, and I'm not sure how she can keep it up for another 2 books, but I suppose it's possible (think: THE GIVER, although I loved GATHERING BLUE, and liked THE MESSENGER--HUNGER GAMES is much more brutal than THE GIVER, though). It's got some very meaty issues to chew on, not the least of which is reality TV taken to extremes. There's a chaste and unresolved romance (think: TWILIGHT, but I don't think I will make it past the first in that series--HUNGER GAMES has much more action, more of a plot, lots of well-developed secondary characters, as well as extremely likeable main characters. I will miss Katniss until I can read about her again.). What more could you possibly ask for out of a book? It doesn't actually come out until October 2008, but if you can get your hands on an ARC, definitely do! I think that the violence in this will be easier for kids to take, since they probably won't see it quite as clearly as an adult will. None of it is particularly graphic, but it is definitely brutal. This is on the edge of too dark for me, which is my favorite kind of book. There aren't many writers who can push it right to the edge for me without going over (Zusak comes to mind immediately), but Collins is definitely one of them. Another book that I loved, and think of to compare this to is HOUSE OF THE SCORPION, but that fell apart slightly at the end for me. HUNGER GAMES didn't lack anything at all for me. OK, I'll stop gushing. I may have to re-write this review when I get some perspective. (2012: Obviously, I never did rewrite it, and this is my most-\"liked\" review :) <br /><br />My 10 1/2 yr old son asked to read this with me, so I read it for the 3rd time with him in Oct 2008. Still my definite favorite book of the year, but all the typos in the finished book were pretty disappointing. Still, it's my choice for just about any award out there, come January, including the JHUNT. <br /><br />Update May 2009: I am dying because the CATCHING FIRE ARC has just been released, and people are saying it's at least as good at HG. I've had 2 teenaged boys at my library read this on my recommendation, and both of them came back asking me for more books like it (really there isn't anything). One of them has pre-ordered CATCHING FIRE on Amazon (updated to say that I worked in a fairly disadvantaged neighborhood in DC at the time, so that was not a usual occurrence). <br /><br />May-June 2011: I'm reading this for the 4th time, with my younger son, who's finishing up 5th grade. Still as good as ever!! Can't wait for the movie!!<br /><br />Update 2012: Between them, HG and CATCHING FIRE were the pinnacle of my 20-yr career as a YA librarian! I've seen the movie twice so far, and definitely liked it better the 2nd time, when it didn't have to try to be my favorite book. :)<br /><br />Update 2020: It's been 9 years since I last read this, but I've never listened to the audiobook, so I decided that having it read to me would be a good activity during the covid-19 pandemic. STILL as good as ever, and the odds will forever be in its favor.",

					"text": "Fantastically Written? Ooooh yeah! Compelling? Yup! Super Quick Read? Most definitely! Original? Um...well *shuffles feet, since I seem to be a rare non-five star-er* not original at all really.... <br /><br />Man, I wish someone on my friends list here has also read Battle Royale and this book! The Hunger Games WAS pretty fantastic, hence the four stars (though I would have given 3 1/2 if the choice was available.) I ate it up, shouting into other rooms and offices that I was going to be shoving the book into their hands as soon as I was done, but as it went on desha vu was a little too common for me. I know there are major story types out there, ones that are repeated over and over again. Shakespeare retold 200 different ways. The bible reinterpreted to 2,000,000 varieties of tales....but when it comes to YA dystopia, which is by far my favorite genre of any book, originality is one of my main ways I judge a book. FEED felt utterly original. The world of UGLIES felt new. LITTLE BROTHER was just plain amazing. If it's going to be about \"the future\" we don't know about, make it original. In my mind dystopia novels survive on \"idea\" more than \"excecution\" and while the execution of this was beautiful, the idea was hardly new. <br /><br />While I have a really good feeling Collins never read, or maybe even heard of, Battle Royale, The Hunger Games was 90% the plot of Battle Royal, minus the guns, the extra blood, the ability to get to know all the other players. In Battle Royal (short explanation of BR plot: 40 students put on island forced to kill each other and winner is set for life and put on TV etc...), the main focus is a love story between two students trapped in the game, two students bonding together with no real urge to kill others...one of whom had a crush on the other forever and it is only revealed during the game. There are so many other similarities, from the ways the gamemakers manipulate, to the ways the media encourages, to one character having a fever and the other taking care of them with soup. There are even \"career\" battle royal players. In BR you see the emotions before and after someone is killed, their last thoughts, the feeling of the person who killed. It's actually really beautiful the way it is done, and so believable that put in an arena teens WOULD turn into savages. In The Hunger Games, yes the main characters were fantastic, and many of the lesser as well, but Foxface is only Foxface, and the Careers are never more than random 1-dimensional bad guys. <br /><br />The Hunger Games was very Battle Royale, very The Long Walk (Richard Bachman book), and very much current reality shows. I am not saying it wasn't a GREAT read, I'm just saying it shouldn't shake the publishing earth the way I am pretty sure it is going to. I anticipate this is the next Twilight series people are going to gush over. In a few years we'll all be hosting Hunger Games final book parties. I'll be amongst the attendees I'm sure. <br /><br />Also in terms of female main characters, Katiniss may surpass Bella in me wanting to shake sense into a character. Talk about a smart girl being utterly clueless! <br /><br />Yes, it was great, but eh, maybe I'm just bitter because I think BR is the better book of the two and while Hunger Games will get tons of praise and likely a rather deserved award or two, BR will continue to be banned in many libraries. Amazing what subtracting guns can do to a story. Suddenly it doesn't feel as violent, but rather is more reminiscent of stories we heard growing up. The number of swords and arrow deaths in traditional fairytales is nothing to freak out about, but if bullets are flying, it will give \"too many ideas\" to teens and therefore must be dubbed an adult book. <br /><br />I'm pretty sure if I hadn't read BR just a few months back this exeedingly long review would have been just as long only instead of a rant it would have just been one long squeeeeeal of delight over how much I loved the book. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Original Comment: Peer pressure, peer pressure, peer pressure. Geez guys! Alright, alright I'll read it!<br />",

					"text": "Clearly Gregor was merely the prelude. Suzanne Collins, you\u2019ve been holding out on us, missy. As an author we were accustomed to your fun adventures involving a boy, his sister, and a world beneath our world. I think it's fair to say that we weren\u2019t really expecting something like <i>The Hunger Games</i>. At least I wasn\u2019t. But reading it gave me a horribly familiar feeling. There is a certain strain of book that can hypnotize you into believing that you are in another time and place roughly 2.3 seconds after you put that book down. <a href=\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/213753.Life_As_We_Knew_It__Last_Survivors___1_\" title=\"Life As We Knew It (Last Survivors, #1) by Susan Beth Pfeffer\" rel=\"noopener\"> Life As We Knew It</a> by Susan Beth Pfeffer could convince me that there were simply not enough canned goods in my home. And <i>The Hunger Games</i>? Well as I walked down the street I was under the disctinc impression that there were hidden cameras everywhere, charting my progress home. Collins has written a book that is exciting, poignant, thoughtful, and breathtaking by turns. It ascends to the highest forms of the science fiction genre and will create all new fans for the writer. One of the best books of the 2008 year.<br />\t<br />Life in District 12 isn\u2019t easy for Katniss and her family. Ever since her father died the girl has spent her time saving her mother and little sister Prim from starvation by hunting on forbidden land. But worst of all is reaping day. Once a year the government chooses two children from each of the twelve districts to compete against one another in a live and televised reality show. Twenty-four kids and teens enter, and only one survives. When Prim's name is called, Katniss exchanges herself without hesitation to compete alongside the baker\u2019s boy Peeta. To survive in this game you need to win the heart of your audience, and so District 12\u2019s trainers come up with a plan. Why not make it as if Peeta and Katniss were in love with one another? But in a game where only one person can live, Katniss will have to use all her brains, wits, and instincts to determine who to trust and how to outwit the game's creators.<br />\t<br />I described the plot of this book to my husband, particularly the part where Katniss and Peeta fake being in love to gain the audience\u2019s approval and the very first thing he said was, \u201cOh! That\u2019s the plot of <i>They Shoot Horses, Don\u2019t They?</i>\" Then I mentioned that it took place in the future and that government leaders set up teenagers to fight one another to the death and he said, \"<i>Battle Royale</i>\u201d. So sure, there are parts of this plot that have been done before. You could say it's <i>The Game</i> meets <i>Spartacus</i> with some <i>Survivor</i> thrown in for spice. But that\u2019s not what makes a book good or bad, is it? Some of the greatest works of literature out there, regardless of the readerships' age, comes about when an author takes overdone or familiar themes and then makes them entirely new through the brilliance of their own writing. Harry Potter wouldn\u2019t have been any great shakes if it weren\u2019t for Rowling\u2019s storytelling. Similarly, Collins takes ideas that have certainly seen the light of day before and concocts an amazingly addictive text. About the time you get to the fifth chapter that ends with a sentence that forces you to read on, you\u2019re scratching your head wondering how the heck she <i>DOES</i> that.<br />\t<br />Your story often rests on the shoulders of the protagonist. Is this a believable character? Do you root for him or her? Because basically it is a very hard thing to create a \u201cgood\u201d person on the page that your reader is going to fall in love with. Because we readers know that we are flawed, we are often inclined to side with the similarly flawed people we meet between a book\u2019s covers. Katniss, on the other hand, is so good in so many ways. She sacrifices herself for her sister. She tries to save people in the game. But there\u2019s almost a jock mentality to her too. Katniss can figure out the puzzles and problems in the game, but when it comes to emotional complexity she\u2019s sometimes up a tree. Most remarkable to me was the fact that Katniss could walk around, oblivious to romance, and not bug me. Seriously, nothing gets under my skin faster than heroines who can\u2019t see that their fellow fellas are jonesing for them. You just want to bonk the ladies upside the head with a brick or something. The different here is maybe the fact that since Katniss knows that Peeta has to play a part, she uses that excuse (however unconsciously) to justify his seeming affection for her. Thems smart writing.<br />\t<br />Oh! And did I mention the dialogue at all? The humor? Yep, there\u2019s humor. We\u2019re talking about a story where adolescents hunger for blood, and Katniss is getting in lines about her trainers like, \u201cAnd then, because it\u2019s Effie and she\u2019s apparently required by law to say something awful...\u201d Good stuff. The words pop off the page. And then there\u2019s the fact that we\u2019re dealing with a dystopian novel where the author has somehow managed to create a believable future. No faux slang here, or casual references to extinct dolphins. There are some animals that were scientifically altered, but you can\u2019t have a future without a couple cool details like that, right?<br />\t<br />In general, this book throws a big fat wrench into the boy book/girl book view of child/teen literature. People love to characterize books by gender. It stars a boy? Boy book. A girl? Girl book. Now take a long lengthy look at the first book in the <i>Hunger Games Trilogy</i>. It stars a girl... and a boy too. There\u2019s a lot of hunting, fighting, and survival... and a lot of romance, kisses, and cool outfits. There\u2019s strategy, the world\u2019s most fabulous fashion designer, weapons and a girl who knows how to fight. This is not a book that quietly slots into our preconceived stereotypes. And you know what happens to books that span genders? They sell very well indeed. That is, if you can get both boys and girls to read them.<br />\t<br />The age range? Well, for most of this story I would have said ten and up. I mean, yeah the basic premise is that a lot of teenagers go around killing one another, and sure there\u2019s some romance to deal with, but none of it really seems inappropriate... until a final death scene appears in the book. I won\u2019t give any details, but suffice it to say it is gruesome. There are definite horror elements to it as well, so with that in mind I am upping my recommendation to 12 and up. I\u2019m sure that there are 10-year-olds out there who\u2019ve seen much worse stuff on cable, just as there are 12-year-olds who\u2019ll freak out ten pages in. Still, I\u2019m more comfortable recommending it for the older kids rather than the younger. You'll see why.<br />\t<br />It occurs to me that there has never been a quintessential futuristic gladiator book for kids. That is undoubtedly the roughest term you can give this book. Now I\u2019m not a person who cries easily when she reads something, particularly something for kids. Yet as I was taking a train to Long Island I found myself tearing up over significant parts of this story. It\u2019s good. And it\u2019s so ridiculous that a work of science fiction like this could even be so good. You think of futuristic arena tales and your mind instantly sinks to the lowest common denominator. What Collins has done here is set up a series that will sink its teeth into readers. The future of this book will go one of two ways. Either it will remain an unappreciated cult classic for years to come or it will be fully appreciated right from the start and lauded. My money lies with the latter. A contender in its own right.<br /><br />Ages 12 and up.<br />",

					"text": "spoilers but do y\u2019all remember that scene in book two where all of the victors are being interviewed and keep saying shit that cuts right to the capitol\u2019s bone, all really purposefully overdramatic, and then right after Katniss gets up and that shit with the Dress happens (which she instantly knows is a life sacrifice one of her only friends is making for her) Peeta gets up on that stage and makes a normal speech and then ends it with \u201cI\u2019d be fine, if it weren\u2019t for the baby\u201d like when is literature ever going to reach those peaks of bad bitch energy ever again<br /><br />I think this series is so fascinating in that it basically spurred an entire genre of sort-of-okay YA dystopians and then a lot of really bad YA dystopians, and it gets put a lot into that category. but... <b>this book doesn\u2019t have any of those same problems that so plagued YA dystopian fiction.</b><br /><br />The love triangle being pointless is <i>quite literally the point</i>; Gale and Peeta are meant to represent the opposite sides of war (something a certain plot point in book three really drives home). Katniss is frankly never romantically interested in either for almost <i>all</i> of books one and two; she grows to care about Peeta in the general sense, not just the romantic sense. The eventual romance works for Katniss because it is <i>safe</i> for her. <br /><br />(What I\u2019m saying is this was tenderness.)<br /><br />I more think this series is interesting in how it talks about the nature of power and <b>the nature of uprising.</b> The uprising, as a whole, is an upswelling of the people, a realization that there is strength in numbers. Yet some of the most revolutionary actions of this series are individual \u2014 it takes Katniss\u2019 desire to save her sister to start a war, Katniss\u2019 love for little Rue to create horror, Cinna\u2019s willingness to sacrifice his life to create a symbol. Even during war, the individual lives of characters like Joanna and Haymitch and Finnick <i>matter</i>. They matter to the narrative, and thus they matter to us too. <br /><br /><input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"spoiler__control\" aria-label=\"The following text has been marked spoiler. Toggle checkbox to reveal or hide.\" onchange=\"this.labels[0].setAttribute('aria-hidden', !this.checked);\" id=\"70ba62ab-9e09-4057-b60d-426ab756cdcf\" /><label aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"spoiler\" for=\"70ba62ab-9e09-4057-b60d-426ab756cdcf\">The ending of book three is essentially a moment in which Katniss realizes that in taking out an old source of power, a new dictator has sprung up in his place on the same level of authoritarianism. I\u2019m going to say it: the moment in which she chooses to shoot Coin is honest to god one of the best moments in literary history.</label><br /><br />Katniss Everdeen is still a deeply revolutionary heroine not only in that she\u2019s written to be fairly gender non-conforming but also in that she is outwardly cold to all but her very few favorite people, and the narrative does not see fit to <i>punish</i> her for it, but to empathize with her and allow her to grow naturally in small ways. Her journey is not in becoming a Nice Person but in self-actualization. That is not a journey female characters are ever ever ever allowed to take and is arguably still something new. <br /><br />I almost want to case study this. It\u2019s a similar dynamic to Lord of the Rings being blamed for the general problems of late-1900s fantasy... but worse, because criticism of the YA dystopian genre so often fell into somewhat misogynistic areas, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any point in denying that <i>The Hunger Games</i>, due to having an image as Something Young Women Enjoyed\u2122\ufe0f, received far more criticism than its equivalents in other genres. <br /><br />It's crazy that the first big ya dystopia is the best ya dystopia and one of the best series of all time, but this one is truly a classic and remains so incredible. Thank you to Katniss Everdeen for being one of the most interesting characters ever written and to this book for having such a dynamic story. <br /><br /><a href=\"https://thebookishactress.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Blog</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jespergayhey\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thebookishactress/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://sptfy.com/4F6I\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Spotify</a> | <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/thebookishactress\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Youtube</a> | <a href=\"https://thebookishactress.carrd.co/#about\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">About</a> | <br /><br /><br />\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br /><b>\ud83d\udd0dTOP THREE REASONS TO READ THG</b><br /><br />1. <b>It's relevant to our world.</b> The parallels to our own society are so amazingly drawn, and the worldbuilding so good, that I'm not surprised this book was the one that broke through. <br />2. <b>Dramatic tension.</b> Tell me you weren't on the edge of your seat every moment of this book. You're lying. Katniss' struggle to survive on her own is compelling and twisty. Every moment is filled with fear and tension. <br />3. <b>The characters are amazing.</b> Katniss Everdeen is one of the best developed, most intriguing protagonists ever written. She's badass and she's selfish and she takes no shit. In the end, I think that's what made this series so fantastic and popular.",

The new country, Panem (as in the \u201cbread\u201d part of Rome\u2019s Bread and Circuses, or supposedly, Pan-America) is not exactly a fun place to live. A decadent Capitol rules over 12 subservient, worker districts. Katliss is a 16-year-old who lives with her depression-incapacitated mother and her 12-year-old sister, Prim, whom she loves more than anything. She lives in the coal-producing District 12, a sooty place in the former Appalachia where life expectancy is as bleak as the food ration is small. She learned hunting skills from her late father and supplements her family\u2019s meager ration with game, hunting frequently with her 18-yr-old friend Gale. <br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1487314194i/21998789.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"xxx\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><b>Suzanne Collins</b> - from fictiondb.com <br><br>Hearkening back to ancient Greece, as a way of demonstrating its dominance over the twelve districts, every year each district must send one male and one female between the ages of 12 and 18 the Hunger Games. Contestants, or tributes, in the very Rome-centric nomenclature of the book, are selected by lottery, but one can get food for increasing the number of entries one is willing to submit. This is not necessarily a lottery you would want to win, as the Hunger Games contest is a gladiatorial battle to the death. Joining an ancient form of barbarity with a more modern version, the contest is seen by the nation on television, gussied up with all the pomp and circumstance of the World Cup, Superbowl and World Series combined, with the degrading intrusiveness of reality television.<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1487316151i/21998928._SX540_.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"xxx\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><b>Primrose Everdeen gets the bad news</b> - from Jabberjays.net<br><br>When the unlucky Prim is selected, Katliss offers to take her place, joining the muscular baker\u2019s son, Peeta. They are transported to the Capitol, dressed up, interviewed on TV, offered training in several forms of combat and sent out there to do or die. The rest is their ordeal, which includes having to succeed not only with physical skills such as strength and agility. In addition to the need for cunning in figuring out how to best their competitors, they have to figure out how to please the television audience, among which are sponsors who might send them much needed goods during the game. <br><br>Katliss is caught not only in a brutal contest with the other tributes, but in a confusing battle with her own adolescent emotions. What are her feelings, really, for her male counterpart from District 12, Peeta, and for her hunky bff Gale back home (team Gale vs team Peeta anyone)? How can she express her rage at the operators of this horror for their inhumanity? <br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1487314736i/21998822.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"xxx\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><b>Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss and Josh Hutcherson as Peeta</b> - from ABC News<br><br>This is a fast-paced and engaging read, even for one who is waaaay past the target YA demographic. I quite enjoyed reading the book, hated putting it down. Collins offers characters one can root for, with enough inner conflict and complexity to matter, well some of them, without it being overbearing, or slowing down the story.<br><br>Ok, I liked the book. But I had a niggling concern early on. When I began reading, I wondered if there might be a political agenda at play. The \u201cCapitol\u201d is clearly the evil tyrant here, with the oppressed working people living in dread of their overlords. Had this story been published in the early-to-mid 20th century, one might presume that the \u201cCapitol\u201d stood in for the fascism of Germany, Italy or Spain, or the totalitarianism of the Soviet Union/Russia or China. However, given the political climate of the twenty-teens, in which cynical forces of the right seek at every opportunity to portray government of any sort as the personification of evil, one must wonder if the author subscribed to the notion. I confess to not having read her prior work, so lack a basis there, and the interviews with Collins I read offer no insight. So, I am not saying that this is so, just that the portrayal made me wonder. I will read more of Collins\u2019 work and look into the subject some more outside pages she wrote, and if I find anything definitive I will update this entry.<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1613707844i/30891681._SX540_.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"xxx\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"> <br><i>Jennifer Lawrence with Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne</i> - image from RogerEbert.com<br><br>PS - Subsequent to writing the above, I read the following two <i>Hunger Games</i> books.

					"text": "<u>\n  <b>My \u2018The Hunger Games\u2019 week</b>\n</u><br /><b>23rd march</b>- movie is released<br /><b>24th march</b>- I read <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/107595450\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">this review</a> and end up watching excellent trailers, Later I downloaded the excerpt and kind of liked the first chapter<br /><b>25th march</b>- I am <s>a proud</s> owner of the book. <s>Yay!</s><br /><b>26th to 27th march</b>- I started reading the book<br /><b>This is how I thought it would go:</b><br />Once I would start reading it, I would just be sucked into it and finish the book remaining awake until early hours of morning, with my bloodshot red eyes.<br /><b>This is how it went:</b><br />I started it and was immediately sucked into the book but then around midway I started losing interest. I fell asleep and had horrible dream (credit to graphic violence). Next morning I finished it owning to its fast pace.<br /><u>\n  <b>This book is special:</b>\n</u><br />This is <b>my first dystopian novel</b>. I was very much excited about it since it was my introduction to a new genre. I would like to thank this book for such amazing description of dystopian world.<br /><br /><u>\n  <b>The book:</b>\n</u><br />This is a kind of book which probably everyone has read including their dogs, cats and birds too!<br />So there is no need to hide the spoilers but as warning-<br /><b>**SPOILERS AHEAD**</b><br />This book started brilliantly and within few pages sucked me into it. The <b>world building part is brilliant</b>. Introduction to districts, new society, people\u2019s life, the rules, the reaping, and yes \u2018The hunger Games\u2019. It is fast paced with simplistic writing. These are all good things. The best part kids are starting to read the books.<br />But that\u2019s where the good things end.<br />Suzanne Collins created the opportunity (golden ones) and one by one she destroyed it. But still most of the people are enthralled by the book as it eventually came out. But I\u2019m not.<br />So I\u2019m going to tell very explicitly what I didn\u2019t like...<br /><br /><u>\n  <b>Using the first person perspective and thus losing the chance to give depth to any character</b>\n</u><br />This story has been told through the eyes of Katniss Everdeen, she just doesn't give a damn about anyone else except her family so naturally the other characters are too shallow and one dimensional.<br />Many people just love Peeta and Katniss but I don\u2019t like either of them. <b>All I knew about Peeta</b> was that he liked Katniss from age of five, saved her twice and is now in love with Katniss, rest is mystery.<br /><b>About Katniss</b>, she does a lot of thing (infact she does everything in the book) but never has a second thought about them, never reflect over what she has done, eventually no attachment with the character.<br /><b>People tend to like Rue, Peeta, Cinna</b> because these are few characters that spent time with Katniss, but (again)no character has depth.<br />One more outcome that I feel from other reviews is that Katniss is definitely heroine of the story but why make other 10 kids villain. While Cato and Clove make their kill they become monster but when Katniss makes her kill, it has to be justified as revenge for killing Rue and pity killing of Cato.<br />This book is all about <b>KATNISS, KATNISS and KATNISS</b>...<br /><br /><u>\n  <b>Very predictable plot</b>\n</u><br />The plot is so much predictable that I was surprised after every 10 or 20 pages (I\u2019m not out of my mind) because the story would turn out exactly how I would guess. First I thought that maybe my mind is highly synchronised with Collins\u2019s mind but later on reading other reviews it turned out the plot was predictable.<br /><br /><u>\n  <b>Missed opportunities</b>\n</u><br />This could have been much more interesting novel. Where did it all go wrong? As I\u2019m writing, everything wrong in story to me looks like is outcome of first person perspective.<br />--I would have felt much more connected to the games had it contained a bit of background information of every important tributes. Despite the killings being graphical, I didn\u2019t felt sad for their deaths.<br />--<b>When Katniss makes her first kill</b>, she moves over to do other things (because Rue is dying). But later when she realises that it was her first kill, still she doesn\u2019t reflect over it even for a minute. Killing other human has effect on the killer, until and unless killer is sociopath, moreover here the killers are kids. Instead of giving insight to their mind the story flatly moves ahead with killing and ending the games.<br /><br /><u>\n  <b>It doesn\u2019t make me think</b>\n</u><br />I read books because I enjoy it and because they push my mind to a new level of thinking which benefit me. This book made me think only about, why I didn\u2019t like this book when whole world is enjoying this. No further thoughts beyond that.<br /><br />Maciek\u2019s thought on this book:<br /><blockquote>\n  <b>\u201cThe Hunger Games reads like a bag of chips, meaning you can devour it in several short bites but it will leave you unnourished and aside from gas, it won\u2019t have much effect.\u201d</b>\n</blockquote><br />FOR ALL THIS <b>2 STARS(**)</b><br />In many reviews people come out with most lame excuse (defense) I have ever heard- <b>IT\u2019s A YOUNG-ADULT NOVEL</b><br />As for other books in the series, I will definitely read them but I\u2019m not in hurry or excited with this prospect. I will read it someday, probably before second installment of the movie.<br /><br /><b>To put a perfect end to \u2018The Hunger Games\u2019 week</b><br /><b>28th march</b>- I watched the movie<br /><b>Movie</b> turned out pretty good, much better than I had anticipated. As I watched the movie it seemed that novel was written with movie in mind. Few minor changes, like in the end President Snow shown thinking representing its start of story unlike novel which ends. Some scenes are breath taking, too much violence. Acting by Jennifer Lawrence is good (she turned out better than Katniss in the book). I liked the movie, rated it 7/10.<br /><br />This review is inspired by <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/212024120\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Maciek\u2019s review</a> and <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/301609727\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Brian\u2019s review</a>.<br /><b>P.S. The kind of reviews and comments I have seen makes me think this book is being followed like religion and my review will sound like blasphemy to them. But I can\u2019t help it, I tried to be honest.</b> <br />",

So maybe Matthew Fox from Lost isn't exactly the person you had in mind when you thought about who they might cast as Katniss in The Hunger Games, but I was inspired to create that after I saw <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jackimals.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">this site called Jackimals.</a> You might want to wait to visit it, though, because it can suck you in like an unexplained time warp flash.<br><br>I was also inspired to create the Jackniss after I read a discussion that deeply disturbed me.<br><br>Somewhere, possibly on Goodreads, I read that someone thought the <u>Lost writers should get involved in writing the Hunger Games script</u>. What!?!? Forget the genius Suzanne Collins, let's give it to the guys who left the greatest mystery in all of TV history completely unexplained. Don't get me wrong. I love Lost and appreciate it greatly, but they really explained nothing in terms of the plot. But don't even get me started on that - Circuits overloading. Bzzzt. *sparks*<br><br>Both Lost and Hunger Games are great character stories, but Hunger Games <em>needs</em> plot. It cannot do without. That's obviously not going to happen since Suzanne has already written the script, but just play along for a second.<br><br><strong>Here's how I think it would go...</strong><br><br><em>Katniss is being chased by one of the mutts who suddenly turns into the smoke monster, which gobbles her up in flashes of lightning and the sound of mechanical teeth grinding while playing a flashback of her life in the District. It quickly chokes her back up realizing she's a candidate to replace Jacob but she's in such shock from the experience that she lays down and dies, with a stunning close-up of her eye closing. Roll credits.</em><br><br>Now,<strong> if you haven't read The Hunger Games yet</strong>, I won't even try to justify why you should. You just should. This is just one of those books that someone says \"This book is AMAZING.\" Then, you take their word for it and read it.<br><br>And seriously, WHY haven't you read it yet?<br><br>This is the kind of book that is so awesome in a completely thrilling and demented and emotional and shocking way that it makes you want to bang your head against the wall while throwing fairy dust in joy. Two things that I have done in the past, but <em>never</em> before at the same time. That's how powerful this book is.<br><br>After that, it makes you want to cry. Cry like a little baby. Like a little baby in it's crib. Then scream. Scream like a frikkin banshee with a frikkin laser beam on it's forehead.<br><br>Before I read this, I had a friend who told me that this book was 100 times better than Twilight. (I'd say that it's actually more like a gorgonzolazillion times better and don't ask me the exact amount that represents. Let's just call it \"To infinity and beyond.\") She also said that it was going to be an even bigger phenomenon than Twilight. I was like \"Hah!\" Let's face it, it can get ridiculous with the Fangirl mobbing and the crying. But I concur. I think this WILL be bigger than Twilight and obviously better. Maybe even Oscar worthy. I certainly hope so, anyway.<br><br>I know that I said I wouldn't try and talk you into reading this book but I honestly can't help it. I'm not sure that I'm doing a great job at it, though.

A deadly competition which is aired live on TV, and in the end there is only one victor, only one survivor. <br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1524142961ra/25401796.gif\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"> <br><br>Katniss Everdeen, a sixteen year old girl from district 12, volunteers to take the place of her little sister in the games. Luckily Katniss is used to surviving under the harshest circumstances. But what Katniss doesn't realise is that being able to kill and hunt is not the only things that will help her stay alive but also forming friendships, alliances, and making sure the audience likes her.<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1509766656ra/24356885.gif\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"> <br>Picking up this book again had me transported to my younger THG obsessed self. I find myself thinking about the hunger games quite often. And how nothing I've read since 2012 has ever had such an impact on me. <br><br>I will always admire Katniss's love for her sister. Her strength and unwillingness to give up. She's spent so long in survival mode that it's hard for her to have normal relationships with people and she constantly questions everyone's motives. I must say though that's probably what kept her alive in the arena. <br><br><i>\n  <b>What would my life be like on a daily basis? Most of it has been consumed with the acquisition of food.

It's been almost 10 years since I first read these books, I noticed things I didn't before. Things that annoyed me then, are clearer to me now and I think I connected to the characters even more than I did back in my first read. <br><br>The writing is not very descriptive. It has little embellishments but I think it does a good job of reflecting Katniss's personality, who is a very straight forward and \u2018no-nonsense\u2019 type of person.<br><br>And while I'm not really a fan of books being told in the first person, I don't mind reading Katniss's POV. The writing is still very immersive and I think Collins did a good job of making the reader feel part of the story. <br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1590761739ra/29561238.gif\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"> <br><br>The fast pacing and action keeps you hooked. I can't even explain the on edge feeling you get while reading this. Even for me who has already read this book and watched the movie countless times. <br><br>Over the years I've fallen out of love with dystopian books and in general I don't really like books set in the future. I know, I know what is wrong with me right?! <br>Maybe it's because, <b>for me</b>, nothing really compares to THG. <br><br>The setting is so unique. I love how the bareness of district 12 is described compared to the ostentation of the Capitol. <br><br>The world of the hunger games is definitely not one I'd ever want to visit ; )<br><br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1584565125ra/29126938.gif\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"> <br><br><br>I'll admit I became very emotional (are we even surprised by now) while rereading this. I think it's because I already know what's in-store for the characters. <br><br>I found it immensely funny how suspicious she was of Peeta and his genuine kindness.<br><br><i>\n  <b>A kind Peeta Mellark is far more dangerous to me than an unkind one. Kind people have a way of working their way inside me and rooting there. And I can't let Peeta do this. Not where we're going.</b>\n</i><br><br>Ah, Peeta Mellark. Our sweet cinnamon roll. He's just so: \u2764\ud83d\udc23\ud83c\udf3b\ud83c\udf1e\u2728<br>Literally can't believe there are people out there shipping Katniss with Gale when we have our precious baker right here. <br><br>The part where be said : <i>\n  <b>\u201cI don't want them to change me in there. Tune me into some kind of monster that I'm not.\u201d</b>\n</i> \u2014 had me crying like a baby. My love for Peeta Mellark knows no bounds. <br><br>Maybe I didn't notice before because I was more concerned for Katniss but this time my heart really felt for Haymitch. Even when you win the games there's still no escaping them. And besides his own horrors he had to face in the games and other things the Capitol did to him, every year he had to watch as two more kids got killed, for which he most likely feels responsible. I never really gave much thought before to how he coped with all that. <br><br>I love the movies and for a long time I believed that they were so great that it might not even be necessary to read the books as long as you've seen the movies (which are master pieces. in my opinion the best adaptations of all time) but during this reread I realised that there is an element to the books that could not be translated to screen. The movies are good companions to the books but could never replace them. <br><br>If you have not read <i>The Hunger Games</i> I highly suggest you try them out. It's never too late! They are great to read no matter your age, but I think they're also really great for young teens who are starting to get into reading or even those who are reluctant readers. Personally these books opened up other world's to me and will always hold a prestigious spot on my shelves. <br><br><i>\n  <b>I take his hand, holding on tightly, preparing for the cameras, and dreading the moment when I will finally have to let go.</b>\n</i><br><br><br>___<br>Rereading this for the first time since i read it way back when!! i already feel like I'm back in 2012 when everyone was so hyped about the movie.<br><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1509861803ra/24365051.gif\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\" loading=\"lazy\"> <br>___<br><i>Oct, 2019</i><br>I was planning to reread these books this year but with <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2861466954\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the prequel</a> coming out in 2020 I'll rather wait closer to that release date.",
